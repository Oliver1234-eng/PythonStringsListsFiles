# In this project, the following tasks have been successfully solved:
# 1. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two strings and forms and prints a new string consisting of the first three characters of the first string repeated twice, followed by the last three characters of the second string. Example program execution: </br> >>> Enter the first string: abcdef </br> >>> Enter the second string: ghijkl </br> Output: abcabcjkl
# 2. Write a program that forms an acronym for a given phrase. An acronym consists of capitalized first letters of words in the phrase. For example, "random access memory" becomes "RAM". Example program execution: </br> >>> Enter a phrase: random access memory </br> Output: The acronym for the entered phrase is: RAM
# 3. Write a program for user registration. The program should allow the user to enter a username and password. User information is stored in a text file. Example program execution after three registrations: </br> >>> Username: pera </br> >>> Password: peric </br> ================================ RESTART </br> ================================ </br> >>> Username: jova </br> >>> Password: jovic </br> ================================ RESTART </br> ================================ </br> >>> Username: steva </br> >>> Password: stevic </br> The users.txt file should contain the following data: </br> pera|peric </br> jova|jovic </br> steva|stevic
# 3. Write a program that reads usernames from a text file and prints them. After executing the program for the users.txt file from the previous task, the output should be: </br> Username: pera </br> Password: peric </br> Username: jova </br> Password: jovic </br> Username: steva </br> Password: stevic
# 4. Write a program that combines the content of two files and saves it in a third file. The first file contains usernames and passwords of sellers, and the second file contains arrays of prices of products sold by the sellers. Each row in the third file should contain the seller's username, the total price of the goods they sold, and the average price of the item they sold. Example program execution - given users.txt: pera|peric, jova|jovic, steva|stevic and invoices.txt: 100|200|150|150|300|100, 50|100|100|50, 300|400|200|100|400. The generated file should be statistics.txt: pera|1000.0|166.67, jova|300.0|75.0, steva|1400.0|280.0
# 5. Write a program that formats a text file according to the following instructions: Every consecutive occurrence of multiple spaces between words should be replaced with a single space. The title is the first line from the file and should be centered in a string of 100 characters, with the first letter of each word capitalized. After the title and before the first paragraph, there should be an empty line. A paragraph is every line in the file except the title. Each paragraph should be indented with five empty characters. Each sentence in the paragraph should start with a capital letter.
